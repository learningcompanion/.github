The Learning Companion is a cloud-native, online-first learning stack designed to transform university course support into a modern learning experience for students by supporting synchronous, asynchronous, and hybrid settings. At its core, the platform utilizes a flexible, headless CMS architecture that provides students with various ways to engage with content, including timeline-, topic-, and conversational-based views. Its most distinctive feature is an AI-enhanced, agentic chatbot that leverages RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and multimodal capabilities to provide course-specific assistance, generate complex modeling diagrams—such as UML and BPMN — and offer automated feedback.
